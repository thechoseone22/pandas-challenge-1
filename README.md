# I answered the questions in cells above them so I could still see the desired ouputs as I worked.
# Parts 1-3 was done in help by Deborah Aina(Our TA) during our study group hours and all questions was answered in part to Chatgpt/Ed-x AI to help

# I also used chatgpt to create the for loops in the problems as they were very hard to create and troubleshoot by myself. I worked through them with
# classmate, Tuan,  and we still could not come up with working for loops for the problems.
